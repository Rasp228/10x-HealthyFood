# Known Drift

Places where 10x-HealthyFood does not yet follow the conventions in @AGENTS.md. The conventions live
there and load every session; this inventory lives here because it shrinks as drift is repaid, and
editing it should not mean editing the rules.

Nothing listed here is a pattern to copy. Each entry names what is out of place, which rule it
predates, and what to do instead.

## Services

### `src/lib/services/recipe.service.ts` is not a server service

Despite the `.service.ts` suffix it is a browser-side `fetch` wrapper over `/api/recipes`, imported
only by React components and hooks. The server-side exemplar is `src/lib/services/ai.service.ts`:
constructed with the request-scoped client from `context.locals.supabase`, given already-validated
input. Do not model a server service on `recipe.service.ts`.

### Routes that query `locals.supabase` from the handler

The `auth`, `preferences`, `recipes` and `users` routes under `src/pages/api/` predate the rule that
business logic belongs in `src/lib/services/*.service.ts`, and talk to Supabase directly from the
handler. They work — do not copy them. A new route parses, delegates to a service, and responds.

## Validation

### Routes with inline Zod schemas

Schemas belong in `src/lib/validations/<domain>/<action>.ts`, following
`src/lib/validations/auth/login.ts`. Still declaring them inline:

- `src/pages/api/ai/generate-recipe.ts`, `modify-recipe.ts`, `save-recipe.ts`
- `src/pages/api/recipes/index.ts`, `[id].ts`
- `src/pages/api/preferences/index.ts`, `[id].ts`
- `src/pages/api/auth/update-password.ts`

Only `login`, `register` and `reset-password` have been extracted so far.

## Components

### Application components sitting in `src/components/ui/`

`src/components/ui/` is shadcn primitives only — `button.tsx` is the only file there that belongs.
`ActionButtons.tsx`, `BaseModal.tsx`, `IconButton.tsx`, `LoadingSpinner.tsx` and `RecipeContent.tsx`
are application components. Do not add to that set; new application components go in
`src/components/{ai,auth,common,feedback,layout,pages,profile,recipe}/`.
